"""
App configuration for the accounts application.

This module contains the Django configuration for the accounts app. It defines
app-specific settings, such as the application's name and the default auto
field type for model primary keys. The use of 'BigAutoField' as the default
auto field implies expecting a large number of objects, suitable for
applications with significant database records.

The 'AccountsConfig' class within this module is used by Django's app registry
to configure app-specific settings.

See Django's documentation on applications and AppConfig for more information:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/applications/
